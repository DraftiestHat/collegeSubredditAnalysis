# collegeSubredditAnalysis

This is for analysing the words used by different college students to see if there can be discerned factors between size, focus, or location.

Resources:

	List of college subreddits came from Reddits "Grow a College Subreddit Competition" from 2011, along with some I found myself (e.g. University of Hawaii's). While this is an old list, I highly doubt there are that many new college subreddits, as reddit was first started being used mostly by college aged people. www.redditblog.com/2011/11/grow-college-subreddit-competition.html
	
	List of Top 500 Used Words in English from world-english.org/english500.htm
	
	Dictionary came from app.aspell.net/create using all spellings, level 3 variants, both diacratic handlings, and including 'hacker' and 'roman numerals'.
