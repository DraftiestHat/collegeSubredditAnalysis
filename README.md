# collegeSubredditAnalysis

This is for analysing the words used by different college students to see if there can be discerned factors between size, focus, or location.

	List of college subreddits came from Reddits "Grow a College Subreddit Competition" from 2011, along with some I found myself (e.g. University of Hawaii's). While this is an old list, I highly doubt there are that many new college subreddits, as reddit was first started being used mostly by college aged people.
